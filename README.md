## 📒 Introduction

EBSBAN 是一个开放源代码、简单易调用、透明公开的线上黑名单系统，采用 Javascript + Ajax 开发。您（工作室、服务器、个人）可以将违规人员的相关信息提交给我们，经证实后可添加到云黑数据库中。EBSBAN 依赖于开源社区的生态快速发展中，目前已经与 [MCBAN](https://mcban.cn/) 等多家云黑机构展开合作。

<hr>

EBSBAN is an open source, simple to call, transparent and open online blacklist system, developed with Javascript. You (studio, server, individual) can submit the relevant information of the violators to us, and they can be added to the cloud blacklist database after verification. EBSBAN relies on the rapid development of the open source community and has already cooperated with [MCBAN](https://mcban.cn/) and other cloud black institutions.

## ❓ Characteristic

Differences between EBSBAN and other cloud blacklist platforms:

- Open source
- No backend (Just Javascript + Ajax)
- Transparent and open (The database ```blacklist.json``` is open and protected with hash values ​​to prevent tampering)
- Fair and Just (All events can only be added to the database after confirmation)
